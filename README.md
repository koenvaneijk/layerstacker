A captivating 3D tower stacking game with modern visuals and procedural audio.


## Description

Layer Stacker is a skill-based game where you build the tallest tower possible by stacking layers on top of each other. Each layer moves back and forth, and your goal is to place it with maximum overlap with the layer below.

The game features:
- Visually stunning 3D graphics with dynamic lighting
- Procedurally generated sound effects and music
- Physics-based animations for falling pieces
- Responsive design that works on both desktop and mobile
